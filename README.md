### WHAT THIS WEBSITE DO
Shows a status of what you're doing! When using the npm package `im-doin` and properly setting it up (once that step is done, that is), you'll be able to fire off status updates with a message and a color/image/(eventually a valid gradientstring or one of a subset of pre-rendered svgish backgrounds), and have it display on your own `imdo.in` website!

### TODO:
*LOTS! THIS ISN'T READY FOR WIDE RELEASE:*
